# Neumorphism-CSS-code-generator
#### A tool that helps generate css ðŸŽ¨ code for Neumorphism UI

It's been a while since the new UI design trend called **Neumorphism/Neomorphism**, inspired from the old design philosphy of **Skeuomorphism** (Widely use din apple ecosystem ðŸ“± before iOS 7), became popular, but I still love how amazing it looks and the asthetics that it provides.
So to simplify the process of writing the code for Neumorphic UI, I built this simple tool.
