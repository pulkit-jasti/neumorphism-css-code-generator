# Neumorphism-CSS-code-generator
A tool that helps generate css 🎨 code for Neumorphism UI

It's been a while since the new UI design trend called Neumorphism/Neomorphism, inspired from the old design philosphy of Skeuomorphism (Widely use din apple ecosystem before iOS 7), became popular, but I still love the astheticsthat it provides.   
So to simplify the process of writing the code for Neumorphic UI, I built this simple tool.
